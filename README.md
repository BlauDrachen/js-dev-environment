# js-dev-environment

## Overview
This project provides a simple boilerplate for future javascript libraries to build off of. It was built using the
assistance of the Javascript Development Environment Tutorial by Cory House which can be found on pluralsight and at
the following github repository https://github.com/coryhouse/javascript-development-environment.

## TODO

This project does not incorporate any kind of JavaScript Error Logging configuration as they cost money and I have yet
to determine one that I prefer.  Also Continuous Integration is currently provided via Travis CI and Appveyor. These
will need to be setup or changed to the CI server(s) of your choice in your environment, However for public git builds
they are satisfactory.
